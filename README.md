## Overview

Entrepreneurship is a big world, and we know how hard it can be to see yourself pursuing it, especially when other careers, like finance, consulting, and software engineering have clear recruiting pipelines that start early in the semester and leave you with a decision before Christmas. That's why WiCS is trying to help you understand it with this Entrepreneurship Guideâ€”hopefully we can clear some of the confusion away and give you answers about the stuff you-don't-know that you-don't-know.

First off, a brief overview of entrepreneurship at Harvard:

1. **There isn't a single, central community in which the best entrepreneurship is going on at Harvard.** Instead, it's diffuse across campus and clustered into friend groups. Institutional centers like the i-Lab or the on-campus clubs provide a lot of resources, but definitely aren't the end-all-be-all of the startup scene. Involving yourself with these communities is a great place to start though, and then asking people who they think you should chat with is a good way to branch out and start building an entrepreneurial community of your own.
2. **There's a lot of information assymetry in entrepreneurship, and much of the information is word-of-mouth or hidden in noise.** That's why it's important to meet with people working on entrepreneurship and involve yourself in the space when you can. The startup scene is a very heterogenous environment, with a wide range of experiences, but if you're committed it can be really rewarding and impactful.
3. **Many resources exist at Harvard, but you have to find out about and ask for them.** Related to the decentralization and heterogeneity, there isn't a clear path or checklist for how to take advantage of the entrepreneurial resources at Harvard. However, if you look for them and are brave enough to ask for them, there are more than you could take advantage of. Most of all, the alumni network is vast, valuable, and only an email or phone call away (as an easy way to get started, reach out to WiCS alum!).

The rest of this doc is broken into three large categories:

* **Miscellaneous or general items under the [Overview](#overview) section.** These apply to the entrepreneurial scene as a whole.
* **The [Joiners](#joiners) section is targetted at people who are interested in joining startups**, but aren't (yet) looking to found a company themselves. This section will attempt to clarify the process of finding, evaluating, and applying to startup companies. It won't make it as easy as the consulting/finance/big-tech recruiting processes, but it will try to make it a little more transparent.
* **The [Founders](#founders) section is targetted at folks who are looking to create new companies.** This section will be focused on resources available on campus and some guidance on being a student founder.

### Terminology

To help with understanding in the rest of the doc, here's some vocabulary that we'll be using and that comes up in the entrepreneurship space.

* **Founder** - Someone who creates a startup.
* **Joiner** - Someone who joins a startup after it's already been created.

*Another place to find terms related to entrepreneurship is [Gust's Startup Glossary](https://gust.com/launch/startup-glossary).*

#### Angels

Angels are individuals who invest their personal capital into early stage companies. One way they can be different from venture capital (AKA institutional money) is that they might be more hands-on with the companies they invest in (e.g. they may have worked in the space), they may be less structured than VC, and they may be more willing to invest at very early stages. However, angels are harder to find then most VCs and don't always conform to VC investing norms.

Sometimes angels congregate into groups that host pitch events. There are several prominant groups in the Boston area:

* [HBS Alumni Angels Association](http://www.hbsalumniangels.com/) - Companies apply for funding via a local chapter, members screen 10-50 companies and invite 4-6 companies for each pitch event. Angels then make investment decisions independently.
* [MIT Alumni Angels of Boston](http://www.mitalumniangels.com/) - Similar to the HBS Alumni Angels, MIT Alumni Angels has ~200 Boston based investors.

#### Venture Capital

The following VCs have student representatives at Harvard. Both DRF and RDV's student reps are also partners with investment making ability. The other funds have separate partnerships that the student representatives help scout for.

* [Dorm Room Fund (DRF)](https://drf.vc/) - Student-run venture fund backed by First Round with partners in Boston, NYC, Philadelphia, and the Bay Area. Writes $20k checks to startups with student founders.
* [Rough Draft Ventures (RDV)](https://www.roughdraft.vc/) - Student-run venture fund backed by General Catalyst with partners in Boston, NYC, and the Bay Area. Writes $20k checks to startups with student founders.
